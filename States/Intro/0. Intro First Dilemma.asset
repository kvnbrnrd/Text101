  storyText: 'As Tharia was starting to head upstairs, Ardian pondered on what to
    do next, riding immediately his loyal Shadowfax to search for any clues leading
    to the their father''s trail, he could ask the servants to let Tharia know she
    can send him a letter to the Nightstalker''s Inn a day''s ride from here, that''s
    where he would be headed and would stay for the night if he finds no clues on
    the way.

    

    Or he could go upstairs with her to check the King''s quarters
    and assess the situation, maybe they could find a clue or some information which
    would point them in a certain direction, but who knows how long that might take,
    time is of the essence, since King Pharian was in his quarters at night, he may
    not be far just yet.

    

    1. Go outside immediately to look for clues.

    2.
    Go upstairs and assess the situation with Tharia.'
