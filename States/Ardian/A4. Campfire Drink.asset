  storyText: 'You arrive at the Nightstalker''s Inn before an hour or two before
    dusk, you decided to skip lunch, you didn''t feel hungry, you''re tired since
    you rode all day and feasted until late yesterday. Your brave horse is tired,
    as you step foot on the ground, you pet him, and as you check in for tonight,
    you ask the keeper to take special care of Shadowfax, you''ll need him sharp.

    

    You
    still have a couple hours, you decide to head to the pond bordering the nearby
    forest to sit and think. Countless questions fly through your head, but your
    mind is hazy, you just know you''re ready to fight if you have to. As you get
    closer to the pond, you see a man sitting near a small fire, you silently crouch
    behind vegetation and look at what he''s doing. You see him drinking from a wooden
    cup and a strong smell of plants fills the air. You seem him starting to leave,
    you have to decide fast, what do you do ?

    

    1. Walk down to the pond
    to have a chat with him.

    2. Find a better hiding spot and stay hidden to
    follow him.'
