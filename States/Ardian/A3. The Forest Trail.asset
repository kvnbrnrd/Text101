  storyText: 'You choose to head down the forest trail, you can see it rained yesterday
    and the morning dew is not making the path any less wet or muddy. You slow Shadowfax
    down to get your bearings but the fog makes it hard to see anything. Everything
    is silent and you don''t see any marks on the ground. You enter the forest and
    the atmosphere becomes more eerie.

    

    You decide to continue on foot
    because of the fog, Shadowfax close behind. After a couple hours, the road goes
    upwards and makes a right, going back in direction of the city. On your left
    you finally see something. Remains of a hasty campfire, recent, from yesterday
    it seems. You see nothing else than a wooden cup with several drops of a strange
    green liquid from which emanates a strong plant smell. You put it in your bag,
    you can see the path better from there, so you ride Shadowfax again and get going,
    the inn is still far, you''d better hurry to reach it before dusk.
