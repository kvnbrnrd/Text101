  storyText: "He stares at you and his facial expression becomes more neutral and
    pensive, it's hard to read what he's thinking. He says it's a simple infusion
    with plants some people around here make, that it's a good thing to drink if
    you're feeling under the weather.\r\n\r\n1. I had never heard from that beverage
    before, how many people around here know how to prepare that and what it is in
    it ?\r\n2. Oh I had never heard of it, that's interesting, I wouldn't say no
    to a cup myself, I also don't feel too good, maybe that would do the trick. Do
    you still have some or can tell me how to prepare it ? (+25)\r\n3. Who around
    here knows that recipe ? It's the first time I'm seeing this. I also wanted to
    ask you, have you heard that the King has been missing since this morning ? (-25)\r"
