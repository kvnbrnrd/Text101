  storyText: 'The man is looking away from the church, so you decide to go there,
    from where you are you won''t hear anything, but the light has not fully faded
    just yet, you''re still able to distinguish faces a bit. Recognizing and keeping
    an eye on a second person which might be linked to all this would be useful,
    maybe you''ll be able to follow that second person too to gain more insight.

    

    The
    gate leading to the church is open, you pass it and sit on the stairs, pretending
    to think and look around. Another person arrives near the man and starts talking
    to him, they seem to be making sure they''re not heard or seen. You can see the
    new person is a man with quite long black hair and some sort of cape, a dark
    color. Their meeting ends, the man you followed here goes in the village, the
    one he met enters the inn, they don''t seem to have noticed you spying on them.
    You get up and enter as well. The innkeeper takes your things and lets you know
    you''ll sleep in Room 4.


    1. Continue...'
