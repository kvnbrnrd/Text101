  storyText: "You walk to the inn and enter directly. You check in with the keeper,
    he asks to relieve you of your burden, it's also a good idea to not carry a sword
    in a tavern. He tells you that you'll be staying in Room 4 tonight and that you
    can sit wherever you want. A table is free directly in the right corner after
    the entrance, exactly where you need to be, it's still early, you're lucky. \r\n\r\nYou
    put an elbow on the table and rest your face in your right hand, it hides the
    side of your face while allowing you to glance discreetly. You see a man arrive
    through the window, long hair, dark purple cape, not too flashy still. He gets
    out of view, you can barely hear two voices on your right, there's too much noise
    around you, you couldn't be that lucky. You think you hear them mention a woman
    but that's about it. You see the man you followed head into the village, the
    man with the long hair and cape enters the inn, he does not look in your direction
    and sits on the other side of the inn, alone.\n\n1. Continue..."
