  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You choose to hide under the rock formation, you see that the back
    of the man is still turned on you so you carefully stand up and while keeping
    an eye on him, you start walking back a bit. He''s still not looking, so you
    turn your back on him and you swiftly run to the rock formation, while keeping
    a hand on your sword.

    

    You reach it and hide behind it. When you
    come out, the man is heading back to the path, so you quickly duck back, he doesn''t
    seem to notice. You wait it out, hoping that the vegetation was indeed shielding
    you from view. After a bit you don''t see the man anymore, you quickly walk the
    path to take a right turn, and when you get a look, you see him a bit further
    ahead indeed, his back turned on you, heading on the path back to the inn.
