  storyText: 'The man is packing his things below near the pond, his back turned
    on you, you quickly glance behind you, the path you took narrows and continues
    around a rock formation, it''s a bit far so you''d have to run. It makes an angle,
    being behind it you''ll be hidden from view, and the vegetation should hide you
    while you''re going there.

    

    On the same path and in the same direction,
    you can see a big fallen tree, the trunk lies down the side of the path, on forest
    ground, with remaining leaves and branches slightly resting on the right side
    of the path. You could quite quickly go around it and lie down on the floor behind,
    it should be enough to hide you from view.

    

    Noise is also something
    you need to be careful of. Where do you hide ?

    

    1. Hide behind the
    rock formation.

    2. Lie down behind the fallen tree.'
