    find my father and I will fight against any number of foes to get him back. (-50)

    I have been sent by the kingdom to find him, and I will spare no efforts finding
    out what happened, you people can rest easy. (-25)

    3. From what I''ve been
    able to gather, the King was at the castle yesterday and was missing this morning,
    he might have been taken, there are no tangible clues or motives that anybody
    knows of. '
