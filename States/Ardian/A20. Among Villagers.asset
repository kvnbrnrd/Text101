  storyText: "You walk to the inn, closer to the man waiting, he doesn't notice you,
    there are three groups of people around the inn. One group of older folks speaking,
    they have to talk louder to each other, not the best choice. There's a group
    of two families, with a couple kids, a little girl notices you, points at you
    to her mother, who tells her off, not the best idea either. \r\n\r\nYou decide
    join the last group, two women and a man, talking about the King's disappearance.
    You hear them discuss all sorts of silly theories. The older folks notice the
    sword and that you're a visitor, the curious girl too, people start flocking
    around you. Both men look at you and see the sword, and seem to cut their meeting
    short. The man you followed leaves in the village, the new man enters the inn,
    he has long hair and a dark purple cape. You enter as well and check in with
    the inn keeper at the entrance, he takes your things and tells you he'll bring
    them to Room 4 for you.\n\n1. Continue..."
