  storyText: 'You walk up the road until you reach Mabian''s house, it''s still dawn
    and the surroundings are silent, the old man must still be asleep at this hour.
    You knock firmly on the door and call out for him, saying you need to speak urgently
    with him. The window of the upper floor opens on the rather confused face of
    Mabian, understanding the urgency, he says he''ll be right downstairs and that
    you can go in and wait for him at the table.

    

    When after quite longer
    than expected he comes down, looking at him closely you can see he seems to be
    under the weather and tired, he asks what brought you here so early. You explain
    what happened, he''s initially shocked, but his face becomes grave and pensive.
    "I''m sorry but I didn''t see or hear a thing, I didn''t stargaze and went to
    bed early, I''m rather tired". He wishes you good luck and you wish him a good
    rest and head back on the main road.
