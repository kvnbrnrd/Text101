  storyText: "A17. Following The Man\r\nYou decide to walk, staying far behind him,
    but close enough to see in which direction he's heading, for now he's not straying
    from the path and seems to be heading back to the village. He stops on the side
    of the road and crouches, it seems like he's examining something on the ground,
    like a plant. He picks the thing up and puts it in one of his pockets. \r\n\r\nWhile
    standing back up, he glances in your direction, he seems to be looking at you
    for a second, you're smart enough to not weirdly stop, you keep on walking normally.
    He seems to be looking at you for a second, and he starts walking again to the
    village. He reaches the village, you're still at a good distance, you should
    not lose his track once you're there.\r\n\r\n1. Continue... "
