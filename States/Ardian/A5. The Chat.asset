  storyText: 'You walk to the pond, get closer to the campfire, the man is packing
    his things, you see him put his cup and other things in a bag, he finally hears
    you behind him, turns back and is startled. You''re still wearing your sword
    after all, and he seems to just be a normal traveler, an unarmed one at that.
    You greet him with a smile, he greets you as well but still seems a bit defensive.
    How do you continue this conversation ?

    

    1. Sorry for the sudden
    question and news, the King is missing, we discovered it this morning. Had you
    heard anything about it ? Have you seen or heard anything unusual around ?

    2.
    I couldn''t help but notice before coming over that you were drinking something,
    I''ve never smelled anything like it, what is it ? (-25)

    3. I left the
    city at dawn and had to skip lunch to arrive here before dusk and the inn won''t
    serve anything before a while. Would you have a bit of food to spare to a fellow
    traveler hours from his next meal ? That would be very kind of you. (+25)'
