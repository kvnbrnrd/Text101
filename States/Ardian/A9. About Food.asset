  storyText: 'You shared a bit about yourself and he seems to be less defensive.
    He smiles faintly and tells you he has a bit of leftovers to share with you indeed,
    he hands you a loaf of bread with a small piece of sausage and cheese. You thank
    him and eat the whole thing so fast you can''t even remember what it looked like.
    His smile seems to widen for a second, and he asks you why you were in such a
    hurry to reach the inn before twilight.

    

    1. I have matters to attend
    to early tomorrow, so I wanted to be there fast so I can knock off early. If
    you''re also staying at the inn tonight, I can buy you a pint to thank you for
    your kindness. (+25)

    2. The King is missing. I''m his son, Prince Ardian,
    I was with him until yesterday night so I know that''s when he disappeared,I''m
    ready to fight any number of foes to go get him back. (-50)

    3. I don''t
    know if the rumors reached this city yet, but the King has mysteriously disappeared
    during the night. I have been sent by the kingdom to find out what happened,
    I came here looking for clues. (-25)'
