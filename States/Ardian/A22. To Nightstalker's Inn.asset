  storyText: "Since the man has talked to you and knows you now you figure it's best
    not to follow him, that you'd instantly be noticed, and you're probably right.
    You decide to lie down in the grass next to the pond for a little while and think.
    This fellow didn't seem harmful or to be a bad person, but in your many fights,
    you found out that even good people can get involved in things bigger than them
    and lose themselves in the process.\r\n\r\nYour instinct tells you that you should
    be careful to every detail and of everyone, your father never would have left
    like that, something happened, for sure. And whoever managed to take him away
    had to be organized, you can't do something like that without planning, having
    a safe place to hide and without informants. You get up, walk back to the village,
    and you enter the inn. The keeper asks for your things, you give them to him,
    he tells you he'll bring them to Room 4, and that you can sit wherever you wish.
    \n\n1. Continue..."
