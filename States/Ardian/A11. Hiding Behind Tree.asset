  storyText: "You choose to hide behind the fallen tree since it's closer, you carefully
    start crouching back while keeping an eye on him. You see him turn around and
    getting ready to walk back, you also turn around, you're not far from the tree.
    You're still crouched and start going around the branches and leaves, you take
    another peek behind your shoulder and you see him almost on the path.\r\n\r\nYou
    decide to hurry it up a bit to finsih going around the tree and lying down, your
    sword gets stuck in the branches, but you manage to quickly remove it and lie
    down, holding your sword so it doesn't make any noise touching the ground. While
    lying down, you don't risk taking a peek, but you can see the branches and leaves
    are still moving a bit. You wait it out and hope you haven't been noticed. After
    a little while, you crawl a bit and take a peek between the leaves, nobody's
    there. You stand up and start walking up the path and when reaching the angle
    of the turn you see him further ahead, walking back to the inn. \r\n\r\n1. Continue...
