  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You go outside looking for clues, you stop by the castle''s front gate
    where, unsurprisingly the guards tell you nobody escaped through there. You order
    them to go look for any weak points within the domain, maybe someone sneaked
    out another way. Going out of the domain, you follow the main road which will
    eventually take you to the Nightstalker''s Inn.

    

    Further up the road,
    on the right side you recognize the house of Mabian. He is a rather old, but
    sharp man, not fond of social niceties, he wasn''t at the feast yesterday, he
    likes stargazing at night, maybe he saw something. You also see a downward path
    on your left, leading to the forest, not as maintained, rather muddy, so maybe
    you could find a trail if people recently passed through there, but could be
    anyone.

    

    1. Go ask Mabian if he saw anything unsual yesterday.

    2.
    Follow the forest trail to see if you can find any clues.'
