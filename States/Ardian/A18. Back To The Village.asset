  storyText: 'You reach the village and see the man still walking a bit further ahead,
    the light of the day starts to fade. You keep on walking and he reaches the center
    of the village, you can see him getting closer to the inn and slowing down. There
    are a few groups of people near the inn and not too far from the man, who stopped
    near the inn, he seems to be waiting for someone.

    

    Across the road
    from the inn, there''s the village''s church, the man is waiting turned facing
    the back of the inn, so if you''re near the church his back will be turned on
    you. You could also try to mix in a group of people nearby, getting closer you
    might both eavesdrop and see what''s happening, maybe they won''t pay attention
    to you among people. Or you can go inside the inn while he''s looking away, check
    in and find a way to hear the conversation, but you won''t see who the man is
    waiting to meet. What do you do ?

    

    1. Place yourself by the church.
    (+25)

    2. Mix in a group of people close by. (-25)

    3. Go inside the
    inn hoping to eavesdrop on them. (+25)'
