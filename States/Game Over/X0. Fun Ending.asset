  storyText: 'The man with the long hair and dark cape stands up. He goes towards
    the counter to order a pint, at least that''s what you think.

    

    He
    turns around, he seems to be looking at someone, he put on a cloak and you can''t
    see his face properly, but you can see his head move, analyzing everything. He
    seems to stop while looking at you, he starts walking in your direction. He stops
    right in front of you, you don''t know what''s going on, but you''re ready for
    anything. The man does not move nor say anything. You start getting angry, you
    ask him what he wants, and to show his face, to which he answers "O.K". You don''t
    have the slightest idea of what it means.

    

    1. Continue...'
